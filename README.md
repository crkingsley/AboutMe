## About Me

I started IT work in the Army, then moved to the Airforce, where I am temporarily on full-time orders. With both branches I configured Switches and Routers. On the civilian side, I work for the Navy at Bath Iron Works as a System Administrator. Managing helpdesk functions, server maintenance, and documentation updates/SOPs. So far I have loved the IT field because I have been able to branch out and challenge myself. It is such a wide field that I will never be bored.
